\cf2 ##Introduction \
\
Conversion to *Christianity* was something hundreds of thousands of Jews experienced before and during the Holocaust. Joseph Jacobs estimates that throughout the nineteenth century the number of Jewish conversions to Christianity worldwide was 204,542. The greatest numbers were in Russia (84,536), Austria-Hungary (44,756), Great Britain (28,830), and Germany (22,520).1 Unfortunately we lack such centralised figures from 1900 to the period of the Holocaust, but we know from post-war testimonies and available scholarship2 that the trend of conversions intensified in many countries immediately prior to and during the Holocaust.\
\
This annotated testimony is accompanied by an article published in SIMON, the academic journal of the **Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Research**. The article describes the main findings of my examination of 97 testimonies, containing details about conversion to Christianity before and during the Holocaust, found in the Fortunoff Video Archive of Holocaust Testimonies. ```yaml:aviary\

\cf2 This introduction borrows some information from that article, such as the state of research on conversion of Jews to Christianity and a summary of the ways in which Fortunoff interviewees remember the experience of conversion and its impact on their sense of belonging. The primary focus, however, is on Hans Frei\'92s life and the way in which his testimony is similar or different to the other 96.\
